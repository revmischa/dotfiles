description: "Go through PR comments"
---

Go through the comments on the current Pull Request (PR) and provide a summary of the feedback.

For each comment, determine if it requires action, such as code changes, explanations, or discussions.

If you can address it yourself, do so, post a comment if it is really necessary. Don't post trivial comments.

Resolve all comments that can be resolved to keep the PR clean.

Ask me only for comments that need my direct input or decisions.

Finally, provide a summary of the actions taken and any remaining items that need my attention.
